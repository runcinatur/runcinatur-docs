## Hooks

Hooks are a way for one piece of code to interact/modify another piece of code.
They make up the foundation for how plugins and themes interact with WordPress Core, but theyâ€™re also used extensively by Core itself.

Routers can execute hooks using controllers methods just add hook on routes.php file:

```
$router->hook("hook_name", "MyPluginController@my_hook");
```

For example, if you want to append a shipping calculator in woocommerce shop:

```
$router->hook('woocommerce_after_add_to_cart_button', 'ShippingController@shipping_form');
```

In controller:
```
  public function shipping_form() {
    global $product;
    $height = $product->get_height();
    $width = $product->get_width();
    $length = $product->get_length();
    return $this->generateView('shipping-form', [
      'height' => $height,
      'width' => $width,
      'length' => $length
    ]);
  }
```
